## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript for the mobile version hamburger menu


### What I learned

This was a fun project.  I learned about linear-gradient and how to use it to set two colors without any blending.  This allowed me to have the impression that the family photo went below the initial colored section.  I also become more familiar with multiple background images and how to layer them.
