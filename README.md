This is my version of the Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page project.


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My take aways:

I really enjoyed this project as it built upon previous projects I have worked on.  

Some of the things I came across while doing this challenge were:
- you can use linear gradient to make a hard line between two colors.  Came in quite handy.
- the expanded capabilities of the CSS background
- multiple different ways to make a hamburger icon functional with the desired effect.
